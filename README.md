pov-viewshed
============

Code for creating fine scale view-sheds in PovRay, e.g. see https://smathermather.wordpress.com/tag/viewshed/ .

This is really early code for doing viewshed analyses in PovRay.  The viewsheds are distinct from most viewshed software in that they explicitly contain tree canopy vegetation, and viewsheds can be calculated for leaf on and leaf off conditions, for those of us with deciduous trees.  The repository contains everything needed to render a viewshed in PovRay, including tree points, a digital elevation model in PNG format, and the PovRay code itself.  Enjoy.
